Welcome to **IEEE VIS 2017**!

After twenty years, we are excited to be returning to Phoenix,
Arizona.  Located in the Southwest, the city is easy to reach and has
wonderful attractions as part of the downtown district near the
convention center and conference hotel.

The forum will be held October 1-6, 2017, and will include programs
for students, academics, artists, industry and commercial
practitioners, government researchers, and anyone with interests in
visualization and data analytics.  The conference trend has been to
draw over 1,000 participants from dozens of countries to a week of
research presentations, tutorials, workshops, panels, demonstrations,
posters, and exhibitions.

We invite you to participate in IEEE Visual Analytics Science and
Technology (VAST), IEEE Information Visualization (InfoVis), IEEE
Scientific Visualization (SciVis), and art program, along with a
vibrant array of symposia that share our week.  Bring your
imagination, your data, your problems, your solutions, your research,
insights, experience, and enthusiasm.

VIS 2017 General Chair  
James Ahrens, Los Alamos National Laboratory
